# Radial-Neural-Networks
Application ofAartificial Radial Neural Networks for the problem of Aproximation of the function of one variable.

Labortatory task - Radial Neual Networks
Apply artificial radial neural networks for the problem of approximation of the function of one variable.
As sample data for network learning, you can use data from the website https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

As a tool to create such a network, use the appropriate matlab functions: NEWRB and NEWRBE.

You can get 10 bonus points for the above task.
The completed task in the form of an appropriate Matlab script should be sent no later than by June 15
